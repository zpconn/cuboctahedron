# Nonidentity Residual Axis Profile Report

This report tracks the first exact external clustering of nontranslation cases
that survive the forced-axis sign filter.

The profiler is:

```text
scripts/nonidentity_residual_axis_profile.py
```

It is not trusted proof.  It is an exact arithmetic diagnostic used to decide
whether terminal nonidentity affine-axis failures are compact enough to become
semantic Lean families.

## Convention

The product order matches the shadow normal-form classifier:

```text
R(w[0]) * R(w[1]) * ... * R(w[12]) * R(x)
```

The profiler:

1. classifies translation/nontranslation using the Lean-checked reduced-shadow
   coordinate;
2. recomputes the exact linear matrix as a diagnostic;
3. applies the exact forced-axis sign filter;
4. for forced-balance survivors, runs the exact terminal affine-axis
   candidate classifier;
5. records capped family keys for terminal failure shapes.

All arithmetic is exact `Fraction`/integer arithmetic.  There are no floating
point tolerances.

The residual terminal failures are highly concentrated by reason:

- most survivors fail because the exact affine-axis start point is outside the
  relative interior of `X+`;
- a smaller bucket fails because the first actual hit is not the prescribed
  next face;
- a rare bucket ties on an edge or vertex.

However, the current coarse terminal-family key is still too fragmented to
justify Lean emission as-is.  The first 100k ranks already produce `1,663`
terminal family keys and `6,330` residual signatures from `9,036` residual
survivors.  Extrapolating that key directly would exceed the low-thousands
leaf target.

## Decision

Accepted:

- The residual-axis profiler is memory-safe and fast enough for bounded
  parallel diagnostic windows.
- The terminal failure taxonomy is useful: start-interior misses dominate,
  with first-hit mismatches and hit ties as smaller terminal shapes.

Rejected for direct Lean emission:

- The current terminal-family key is not compressed enough.  It remains a
  diagnostic coordinate, not a final generated theorem coordinate.

Next nontranslation work:

1. Either strengthen the terminal quotient so start-interior misses are grouped
   by a symbolic separating-face/inequality template rather than by exact
   margin, or promote signed-state empty-cone/Gordan prefix pruning before the
   terminal affine-axis stage.
2. Keep the forced-axis sign filter as a cheap front-end filter.
3. Do not generate terminal residual Lean leaves until the planned semantic
   family count is below the low-thousands gate.
